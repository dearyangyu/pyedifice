Extra Elements
==============

Edifice also provides a few extra Elements that provide useful but non-core features.

These Elements are *not* imported into the :code:`edifice` namespace.
To use them, you have to import the module from :code:`edifice.extra`::

    from edifice.extra.matplotlib_figure import MatplotlibFigure

User contributions are of course welcome!

.. currentmodule:: edifice.extra
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: stubs
   :recursive:
   :template: custom-class.rst

   ~pyqtgraph_plot.Plot
   ~matplotlib_figure.MatplotlibFigure
